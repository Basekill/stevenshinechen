I am currently a 4th-year student in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) department at MIT, where I am studying as an exchange student in Computer Science from Imperial College London.

I am currently working on multimodal neurosymbolic AI for my Master's thesis under
the supervision of [Paul Liang](https://pliang279.github.io/).

I completed a UROP under the supervision of [Dr. Ronald Clark](https://www.ron-clark.com/), where I applied Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to perform RGB-D SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).
